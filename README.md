# **User Experience (UX)**  

### Primary Goal

Parenting is a rewarding but challenging journey, and no one should have to do it alone. Inspired by the saying “It takes a Village to raise a child,” It Takes a Village's primary goal is to be a community-driven app that connects parents within the same neighborhood, helping them build a trusted support system. Whether you need a last-minute babysitter, parenting advice, or looking to connect with other parents in your neigbhorhood, this app creates a digital Village where support is always within reach.

- This website currently serves a dual purpose:

    1. Connect: In a world in which people get more and more physically isolated through technology, we want to use that same technology to bring people back together. Parents specifically, who need people close around them to connect on the upbringing of their children, but also to connect with another person for their own benefit.

    2. Support: Life happens. And we are not always prepared for it. Especially the life of a parent can be very unexpected. This website tries to create that digital Village that allows fellow parents to help eachother when it is most needed. Parenting can be a very daunting task, but having people around you, who are or have been going through the same, can be a huge support. Physically as well as mentally.

*. Education: A future use of Village would be to educate parents on some of the essesntials of parenting. Although there is not ONE way to do it right, there are several ways how NOT to parent. Providing guidance, where possible locally inspired can be a huge help to parents of children of all ages.

### First Time Users

- New users can access can read through existing support posts to see that they are not alone and to see how other parents would have solved similar challenges

- New users can find parents and support posts in their own neighborhood, to connect with

- New users can easily use the the contact form to reach out to Village with their own support requests

- New users have the option to not interact at all, but just to learn from their fellow parents

### Returning Users

- Returning users will find the same support posts and can interact with them ones logged in

- Returning users can connect with fellow parents in their neighborhood and start building their own digital Village

- Returning users can easily use the the contact form to reach out to Village with their own support requests

- Returning users who would have posted on Village, can expect replies from fellow parents and interact with them from there

### Support posting list

 ![Support Post listing](/static/images/README-images/support-post-listing-screenshot.png)

When arriving at the homepage of ITAV, the user immediately arrives at the support post list. This to ensure minimum amount of steps are needed for the user to get what they came for.

### Pagination
With "Next" and "PREV" buttons, the pages are limited to 10 support posts. This to increase loading times and reduce clutter.

### Support posting Form
<details open>
<summary>Support post Form </summary>  

![Support post form](/static/images/README-images/support-post-screenshot.png)
</details> 

A simple form, that allows the user to enter a support post. All fields are required, however only the topic and content fields have not been prepopulated. Therefor the remaining fields can be left as is, unless desired. The form has a "back button" in case the user decides to stop their initial posting effort.

1. **Topic**:
- Parents have a large field to explain their post. Whichever goal they have, they have the space to explain and indicate what, when and why they would like to ask/give support.

2. **Content**:
- Parents have a large field to explain their post. Whichever goal they have, they have the space to explain and indicate what, when and why they would like to ask/give support.

3. **Region**:
- As the main aim is to connect parents locally, location is essential. Currently the website is meant for parents around Dublin, Ireland. Therefore the Dublin regions (Dublin 1-24) can be added.
- The location/region will be visible to other users, which will help to localise other parents
- The location/region can be used to filter on relevant support posts.

4. **Age group**:
- Parents of children in different age groups, might be in search for other things at different times. Being able to specify the age group that a support post is meant for, will help identify ones support post to the relevant parents.
- Options are:
    - "Not specified"
    - "Baby (age 0-1y)"
    - "Toddler (age 1-3y)"
    - "Child (age 4-12y)"
    - "Teenager (age 13-19y)"
    - "Young adult (age 16-24)"
    - "Multiple ages"

5. **Type of Post**
- Parents will come to Village for support, but also to connect and offer help. It is therefore important to clarify the purpose of a post:
    - Support ask: Poster asks for help
    - Support offer: Poster offers help
    - Tips & Tricks: Poster offers information and learnings
    - Not Specified: Poster is looking for something that does not falls on any of the above three options

5. **How to Use It**:
- Provide a clear topic to the post
- Give the relevant context for the post and explain what outcome is desireable
- When relevant, provide the location, age group and the type of post.
- Submit the Support post


### Ability to provide support through support replies
The aim of Village is to create interaction. To connect parents locally. The reply function allows for parents to interact with the posts that they see on Village. To offer help, support and/or information.

# **Platform Goals**   

THe primary goal of "It Takes A Village" is to provide a 'digital' Village, to create location-based connections between parents, that will lead to supportive relationships with your physicaly neighbors. The website will achieve this by having location based support posts, allow for age group filtering and driving interactiong between parents on the posts through replies.

### Key Goals:
1. **Parent connect**
    - Bring parents together locally. With people today being more disconnected with their local communitiy, not knowing their neighbors, finding out that there are parents that can help and support potentially 3 doors down, is a great discovery
    - Help parents connect with kids that are of the same age range
    - By providing information about where from the post was made, users can find fellow parents in the region they desire

2. **Parent support**
    - Parents without much support will know how much it is needed on a day-to-day basis. Village will provide a place for parents to search for advice and to ask fellow local parents for support
    - When support posts are placed online, other parents can reply and provide their assistance

3. **Making parents lives easier**
    - By being able to find parents in the same region, local digital Villages can be created, which can transfor into phsycial meet ups between parents and/or their children
    - Knowing that different parents deal with the same struggles, can provide helpful insights, and piece of mind for users when browsing through the posts

4. **Functionality and design**
    - The platform is designed to be simple to access and simple to use.
    - Practical for mobile and desktop use
    - Using minimal imagery to reduce clutter

*. **Education** (future)
    - Provide resources and experiences for parents from other parents
    - Link to local support structures and or useful companies

### Problem Statement
Raising a child can be hard, raising several children even more so. With both parents often working, having busy lives and often living away from family. Having your local support structure in place, can mean the difference between a happy house hold, or one that struggles. Many parents lack the time and tools to connect with other parents in their region, or have no awareness of the amount of parents locally that deal with the same.

### Objective(s)
- To create a secure and user-friendly platform that provides a place for parents to connect with others, find support and offer help where possible.
- To provide a safe space for parents to share experiences and ask for help
- Create local communities (Villages) that make the lives easier of the parent and the child

### Target Audience
- Parents of children of all ages
- Parents that do not have a local support structure in place
- Parents that look for connecting with other parents
- Parents looking for support in their day-to-day
- Parents in general, looking for specific situations and how they would have been resolved 

### Benefits
- **Empowerment**: Being able to build/choose your own 'family'/Village and support structure. Take control of your struggles, together with others.
- **Awareness**: Knowing that there are other parents also struggling, also looking for help and also willing to reach out and connect.
- **Encouragement**: You are not alone.
- **Learning**: Every parent will have had to start parenting for the first time. A platform providing help, support and community will bring a lot of learning in these early phases.
- **Solutions**: Most parents deal with the same struggles, together with other parents we can find solutions

# **Future Features**

As the platform evolves, we aim to introduce additional features to enhance its functionality and expand its impact.  

### 1. **Search function**
Something essential to simplify the use of the platform will be the addition of the search bar. Allowing users to search through existing posts based on keywords and filters. This will greatly ease the use of the platform and make it more convenient to the user to find the relevant posts.

### 2. **Build your own profile**
To be able to provide more information about yourself and your family, the Village platform would allow the creation of your own profile/family page. You can then share the page with any parent that you trust. In this way other parents know how they can help and potentially what they could ask from you as well. If your profile says you have a 5 year old? Perhaps there are other 5 year olds in the neighborhood that are looking for another kid to kick a ball with.

### 3. **Profile security**
Because of the limited security options at the moment, the platform is forced to function on a retalively basic level. Increased security of the contact details and the ability to reach out and ask for contact details directly, should keep away personal information from the public space where this is not desired.

### 4. **Filter options**
Expanded and improved filter options should improve the user experience. Allowing users to only see Support posts relavant for them and filter out any potential clutter. Possible filter improvements are: Looking for playdates, parent specific support, parent connect, siblings, religion, type of activities, Guidance, Education and more.

### 5. **Create your own Village (community)**
The current set up is focused on Dublin only. The It Takes A Village app would allow in the future the ability to create your own Village, with it's own Village moderator. Given the ability to only invite parents that have connected before and know each other. Or leave the joining of the local Village open to a specific area and/or for a specific parent niche. Support posts and replies would be locally managed between the parents that have joined the Village.

### 6. **Specific support Villages**
Sometimes parents are only looking for a specific type of support. Villages could be set up around specific topics, bringing parents together with specific similar interests. Being able to go in deep into the subject matter with parents of a similar mind.

### 7. **Connect directly on the platform (privately or with a group)**
Connecting Parents, is one of the primary goals of the It Takes A Village platform. Being able to connect with eachother privately, without others being able to see your private contact details is in that case essential. Having it's own communication platform, or having a way to function as a 'filter' between users, will allow for quicker, easier and safer communication within villages.

### 8. **Add images**
By adding images to Support posts, replies and in the future profiles, parents can make their communication easier and more fun. There will have to be limitations in place on the quantity and quality of images to reduce insensitivy and clutter.

### 9. **Map integration**
Being able to see how many other parents are present in (your) a certain area, can help parents connect with others. Parents will be able to allow for direct contact or not. Through this, also without support posts, parents can find each other and connect if desired.

### 10. **Detailed location based**
Dublin is the main area at the moment. Ideally the It Takes A Village platform is useable around the world. Parents should therefor be able to sign in with their desired location (and be able to see/invite other parents in their area). 

### 11. **User feedback (help the platform be better)**
The platform aims to support, important in that case is, that support is given in the right way. Users should be able to share their feedback so that the platform can be improved and adapted over time and if need be, for specific area's/cultures.

### 12. **Village calendar**
When a local Village is created, being able to share events, support and/or requests via a calendar, can simplify the communication and intensify the connection. Perhaps a parent is going to the Park on the Saturday afternoon? Put it in the calendar and other interested parents and their kids can join.

### 13. **Partner with local/external affiliate groups**
There are many organisations already supporting parents in many different ways. A challenge however at times can be visibility. By adding local affiliate groups or organisations, parents know what is in their neighborhood and who they can turn to for support (next to their fellow parents). A priority of the platform is to make the parents's life easier, often local groups/organisations can do just that.

### 14 **Partner with local businesses**
Many local shops, businesses, schools and organisations specifically tailor to children and their parents. Having them added to the platform will make it again easier for parents to find their way in their local community.

### 15. **Advertising possibilities**
Local businesses would be able to advirtise their products/services on relevant pages/posts, to get exposure to parents. 

### 16. **Country specific Villages**
Each country/culture might require a different layout of the platform, different languages and different services. This is something that could be designed where needed.

### 17. **Kids entertainment**
External simply games could be linked to the platform. The aim is to make the lifes easier of the parent. For some this means giving their children some distracion, which could to a limited extend be provide by the It Takes A Village platform.

### 18. **(Expanded) User guidelines**
Clarity on topics that are relevant, no rudeness, foul language and/or hatespeech are all essential to feeling safe on the platform. When signing on to the It Takes A Village platform, it should be clear to the user what is acceptable or not. With the possibility for the It Takes A Village team, to take action accordingly when this is needed.

### 19. **Specific educational content**
The idea of the It Takes A Village platform is peer-to-peer. This does not mean that general information is not welcome. If there is a platform where parents come together, it is a perfect location for general education and to look for general information. Parents will be able to share, upvote and comment on this information to let others know how useful it was for them.

### 20. **Showcasing the amount of replies on a support post on the list view**
The interactivity of a post can mean a lot to the user. Seeing that a support post, placed by another has several replies, can mean that the answer will already have been provided. It is then interesting for a user to interact with these post specifically. Users that are on the platform to help others, can then screen for posts that do not have many replies and provide the answer.

### 21. **User levels/badgesw**
To reward active participation on the platform, it will be beneficial to award users with specific levels, perks or even visual badges that can be displayed on their profile page and next to their name on the platform. Seeing posts and replies from these type of users can give additional gravitas/weight

# **Testing**

### HTML Validation
To validate HTML I used the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/). I found it challenging to get a clear image showing the correctness of the different templates as due to the cross referencing of templates, specific errors were shown for different validation tests. When using the HTML code directly, mostly the tests showed errors concerning the Django template language or other Django presetup templates.

<details>
<summary>Example of Django template error</summary>  

![Example of Django template error](/static/images/README-images/html-validation-django-language-templates.png)
</details> 

Or it was asking for the standard HTML start of a template document. Which I am currently unsure to resolve.

<details>
<summary>Basic HTML setup example</summary>  

![Basic HTML setup](/static/images/README-images/html-validation-missing-base-html.png)
</details> 

Also the provided CSS was flagged as incorrect.

<details>
<summary>Preset CSS flagging example</summary>  

![Preset CSS flagging](/static/images/README-images/html-validation-django-preset-css.png)
</details> 
 
 Additionally, when using the database with the the summernote extension, it caused for double paragraph tags, which are not to be found in the standard HTML template, but are added through Summernote.

<details>
<summary>Double paragraph tag example</summary>  

![Double paragraph tag example](/static/images/README-images/html-validation-double-paragraphs.png)
</details> 

One specific error I was not able to figure out, was a list error. Stating that a "li>" tag could not be a child of a "div>" tag. Which I fixed by indeed including the list items in a "ul>" tag as is the standard. However after adding this, the error was still shown. 

<details>
<summary>List error example</summary>
