## User Experience (UX)  

### Primary Goal

Parenting is a rewarding but challenging journey, and no one should have to do it alone. Inspired by the saying “It takes a village to raise a child,” It Takes a Village's primary goal is to be a community-driven app that connects parents within the same neighborhood, helping them build a trusted support system. Whether you need a last-minute babysitter, parenting advice, or looking to connect with other parents in your neigbhorhood, this app creates a digital village where support is always within reach.

- This website currently serves a dual purpose:

    1. Connect: In a world in which people get more and more physically isolated through technology, we want to use that same technology to bring people back together. Parents specifically, who need people close around them to connect on the upbringing of their children, but also to connect with another person for their own benefit.

    2. Support: Life happens. And we are not always prepared for it. Especially the life of a parent can be very unexpected. This website tries to create that digital village that allows fellow parents to help eachother when it is most needed. Parenting can be a very daunting task, but having people around you, who are or have been going through the same, can be a huge support. Physically as well as mentally.

    *. Education: A future use of Village would be to educate parents on some of the essesntials of parenting. Although there is not ONE way to do it right, there are several ways how NOT to parent. Providing guidance, where possible locally inspired can be a huge help to parents of children of all ages.

### **First Time Users**

- New users can access can read through existing support posts to see that they are not alone and to see how other parents would have solved similar challenges

- New users can find parents and support posts in their own neighborhood, to connect with

- New users can easily use the the contact form to reach out to Village with their own support requests

- New users have the option to not interact at all, but just to learn from their fellow parents

### **Returning Users** 

- Returning users will find the same support posts and can interact with them ones logged in

- Returning users can connect with fellow parents in their neighborhood and start building their own digital village

- Returning users can easily use the the contact form to reach out to Village with their own support requests

- Returning users who would have posted on Village, can expect replies from fellow parents and interact with them from there

### Support posting list

1. **Description**:
- Parents have a large field to explain their post. Whichever goal they have, they have the space to explain and indicate what, when and why they would like to ask/give support.

2. **Location**:
- As the main aim is to connect parents locally, location is essential. Currently the website is meant for parents around Dublin, Ireland. Therefore the Dublin regions (Dublin 1-24) can be added.
- The location/region will be visible to other users, which will help to localise other parents
- The location/region can be used to filter on relevant support posts.

3. **Age group**:
- Parents of children in different age groups, might be in search for other things at different times. Being able to specify the age group that a support post is meant for, will help identify ones support post to the relevant parents.
- Options are:
    - "Not specified"
    - "Baby (age 0-1y)"
    - "Toddler (age 1-3y)"
    - "Child (age 4-12y)"
    - "Teenager (age 13-19y)"
    - "Young adult (age 16-24)"
    - "Multiple ages"

4. **Type of Post**
- Parents will come to Village for support, but also to connect and offer help. It is therefore important to clarify the purpose of a post:
    - Support ask: Poster asks for help
    - Support offer: Poster offers help
    - Tips & Tricks: Poster offers information and learnings
    - Not Specified: Poster is looking for something that does not falls on any of the above three options

5. **How to Use It**:
- Start by typing the details of the situation in the description box.
- Provide the relevant location, age group and the type of post.
- Submit the Support post

<details open>
<summary>Report Form - Report incident </summary>

# **Goal**   

THe primary goal of "It Takes A Village" is to provide a 'digital' village, to create location-based connections between parents, that will lead to supportive relationships with your physicaly neighbors. The website will achieve this by having location based support posts, allow for age group filtering and driving interactiong between parents on the posts through replies.

### Key Goals:
1. **Parent connect**
    - 
2. **Parent support**
2. **Functionality and design**



### Key Goals:
1. **Awareness and Education**:  
   - Provide resources to inform users about human trafficking and its impact.  
   - Signpost users to additional resources for reporting and researching the issue.  

2. **Reporting and Support**:  
   - Develop a report form that allows users to describe incidents and pinpoint locations using the What3Words API.  
   - Offer the option for users to remain anonymous or provide contact details for follow-up by authorities.  

3. **User Safety and Accessibility**:  
   - Include a quick exit button ("To Safety") to protect user privacy by redirecting them to another site and clearing their browsing history.  
   - Ensure the site is easy to navigate with clear sections for reporting, educational resources, and organizational information.  

4. **Functionality and Design**:  
   - Integrate a database to store reported incidents securely, with CRUD functionality to manage data.  
   - Design wireframes to guide the layout of key pages such as the landing page, navigation, footer, and contact sections.  
   - Use images, logos, and favicons to enhance the visual appeal and branding of the site.  

## Problem Statement  
Human trafficking remains a pervasive global issue, affecting millions of people and often operating unnoticed within communities. Many victims lack accessible tools to report their situation or seek help, and witnesses often don't know how to act. Additionally, the lack of awareness surrounding human trafficking leaves many unaware of its severity and prevalence.  

## Objective(s)  
- To create a secure and user-friendly platform that raises awareness about human trafficking and modern slavery.  
- To provide a safe space for victims and witnesses to report incidents while maintaining their privacy and anonymity.  
- To offer educational resources for users to understand and combat human trafficking.  
- To support authorities and organizations with detailed, actionable data collected through reports.  

## Target Audience  
- Victims of human trafficking seeking help or a way to report their situation.  
- Witnesses or concerned individuals looking to report incidents anonymously.  
- Organizations working to combat human trafficking and provide safe spaces.  
- General users seeking to educate themselves about human trafficking and its prevention.  

## Benefits  
- **Empowerment**: Victims and witnesses are provided with tools to take action safely and anonymously.  
- **Awareness**: Users gain access to valuable resources, increasing public knowledge about human trafficking.  
- **Safety**: Features like the "To Safety" button prioritize user privacy and security.   
- **Impactful Reporting**: Reports submitted via the platform include detailed descriptions and geolocation, offering actionable insights for authorities.

## Future Features  

As the platform evolves, we aim to introduce additional features to enhance its functionality and expand its impact.  

### 1. **Safe Place Registration Form**  
We plan to develop a dedicated form where organizations can register themselves as designated safe spaces for victims of human trafficking. This form will include:  
- Basic organizational details such as name, address, and contact information.  
- Descriptions of the services offered (e.g., shelter, legal aid, counseling).  
- Verification steps to ensure the authenticity and reliability of listed organizations.  

### 2. **Safe Places Directory Page**  
A dynamic page will be created to display a directory of registered safe places. This page will include:  
- **Search by Location**: Users will be able to search for safe spaces near them using a location-based filter.  
- **Map Integration**: A visual map with pins representing the locations of registered organizations.  
- **Detailed Information**: Each organization listing will include a brief overview, contact details, and available services.  
- **User Feedback**: Option for users to provide feedback or reviews on listed safe spaces to maintain accountability.  

### 3. **Enhanced User Support**  
- Integration of location-based services to provide users with real-time suggestions for nearby safe places.  
- Collaboration tools for organizations to communicate and coordinate with one another directly through the platform.  

These features aim to create a robust support network and ensure that victims have easy access to trusted resources when they need them most.
